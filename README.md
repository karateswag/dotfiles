## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your home directory:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/karateswag/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
```

1. Change into the dotfiles directory:

```shell
cd ~/.dotfiles
```

1. Run the setup script to create symbolic links for the dotfiles:

```shell
./dotfiles_setup.sh
```
The setup script will prompt you to choose which dotfiles you want to link and will create the necessary symbolic links in your home directory.


BTW, I use Arch!
